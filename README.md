*There is currentley a conflict that needs to be resolved, i do have the code that works, but right now for some reason the github version you can pull has a duplicate error within the code*

I have not idea whats happened to the code guys... you cant just push broken code when people want to work on it! someone needs to fix it.

Game Ideas, concepts:

- 3rd person isometric (visible character)
- dungeon based
- simple combat
